 This project is a basic web application consisting of a single page.
 Main web page lists users in the system and user could add , update or remove a user.
 Project developed with using these technologies :
  - Maven
  - Spring (Core , Data , MVC)
  - MongoDb
  - ReCaptcha
  - Junit
  - Log4j

  In order to test the project you need the deploy project in a server. In test purposes i used Apache Tomcat 8 .
  Project is not tested on any other server.

  Notes.
Development Environment :
      - MacOSX El Capitan
This project hasn't been tested on other environments. But you shouldn't expect any issues on diffrent platforms.
However there is a problem with MongoDb instillation on MacOsx.
If you're usin brew to install MongoDb you will probably face with the same issue. After installing MongoDb
you should run this commands in that order via terminal :

-- sudo mkdir -p /data/db/
-- sudo chown `id -u` /data/db
